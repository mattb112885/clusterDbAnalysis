main.sh 

BLAST benchmark:

Time to run blast will go roughly as N^2 where N is the number
of organisms (assuming they have roughly the same number of genes)
and as k^2 where k is the number of genes per organism.

Running on 12 (reasonably fast) cores BLASTP took on average
somewhere around 6 seconds per pair of bacteria... 

For the test set of 24 organisms it took roughly

6 s/org pairs * 24^2 orgpairs * 1 min/60 s = 57 min

to run BLASTP all vs. all. The algorithm is embarassingly parallel,
so scale up or down according to the number of cores you have.

BLASTN all vs. all takes less time but will still be in the hours+
range for a larger number of genomes.
On the same machine (using 12 cores of processing) it took about 
1.5 seconds per pair of organisms.

1.5 s/org * 24^2 org * 1 min/60s = 15 minutes

Loading up the SQLite database took about 30 minutes for the set of 24
Enterobacteria we have analyzed. This will roughly increase as O(N^2) as well
(depending on the number of BLAST hits between each pair of organisms, which 
could vary wildly). Unlike BLAST, this step is not parallelized.

Everything else done in main.sh is completely insignificant in time
compared to the BLAST computation and data loading steps.

main2.sh

MCL benchmark:

Most of the time in running MCL is spent querying the database for
all BLAST hits between a specific group of organisms and calculating the
desired homology scores.

It took me about 1 minute per million edges to perform this query.
Obviously this time will increase as the database gets bigger.

There are about 20 million BLAST hits between 30 closely-related prokarytotes 
(~3000 genes/organisms) with an E-value cutoff of 1E-5.

Running main2.sh on the 24 Enteric set took about 5 minutes but it goes as
about N^2.
